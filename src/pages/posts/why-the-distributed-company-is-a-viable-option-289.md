Remotely managed companies nowadays have benefits.

As an employer:
- you don't need an office
- you don't need hardware for your employees
- you don't have to select employees only from the local area
- your employees are already equipped with hardware
- you don't need to pay for bandwidth enough for comfortable work of many people
- you don't need to buy fancy stuff for an office, e.g. ping-pong table, watercooler, etc.
- you need less money to start your business
- you can afford to run several businesses
- you can travel and keep growing your business
- you can decrease your carbon footprint to zero!

As an employee:
- you can work with any company in the world
- you don't need to spend time to commute
- you can organize your workspace to your needs
- you can benefit from online services such as codesandbox.io to start working at no cost
- you do not need to bother about dress-code
- you can spend more time with your relatives and beloved
- you will eat healthy food of your choice
- you can work out as many times a day as you want
- you choose the time to work - no more 9 to 5 schedule
- you can attend conferences and keep working
- no problem with scheduling a visit to a doctor, advocate, etc.
