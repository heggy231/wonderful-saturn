In this series of articles, I want to share approaches to building an app with [Angular](https://angular.io/).

Starting a new project from scratch is like facing a blank page - you'll never know what it will be like when it's over. For me, this always the route to wonders.

In continuation of the allegory of a blank page - it is very important which tools you will use. Pencils, chalks, coal, or paint - each of these tools require specific knowledge and a certain amount of mastery.

The same is true for the world of IT.

A lot of tools exist to achieve goals. Among these tools, there are different libraries/frameworks to build a user interface: [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Angular](https://angular.io/), etc.

All of these wonderful solutions require the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and NPM (node package manager) to be at least installed. Moreover, the tooling provided by these packages runs in the Node.js environment.

Does the above mean that it is a prerequisite to know [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and how it works?

No. The maintainers of these packages made their usage as simple as possible.

However, to get started a new project, you need to install/setup/configure some set of software.

So, here comes the first article of the series, and it's called Prerequisites.
