Recently I discovered that it is possible to build a blog from posts on the [dev.to](https://dev.to).

Isn't it awesome?

To make it happen, you need to have an account at [GitHub](https://github.com).

Once you [create](https://github.com/join) an account, you can sign in to the [dev.to](https://dev.to/users/auth/github).

Next, you need to go to _Settings_ - _Integrations_ and tap [Create New Stackbit Site](https://app.stackbit.com/create?ref=devto).

Once you on the Stackbit's start page, it takes four steps to create __your__ blog:
- select a theme

- choose a site generator

- connect to your dev.to account
![Alt Text](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/7oolza73f4ce8mdn55y8.png)
- deploy your blog
![Alt Text](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/os035sr5xw26dex6kvuy.png)

> If you don't have a [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) account, then it will take several minutes to sign up using the Github account.

As a result, you will have a new repository in your Github account.

Next, you need to correct the default data from the start page.

To do so, go to your Github repository then navigate to _src/pages/index.md_.

Once you are where click the edit button and let your fantasy fly a bit around to write something about yourself!
